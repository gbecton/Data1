# Data Anaysis Practice

These files show different topics of Data Analysis that I have worked on throughout college. Although these are not personal projects, they have helped me to understand data science and how to approch problems. You can find topics like webscrapping, SQL and big data in these practice examples. The experience that I have gotten from these practice examples has prepared me to do my own projects.
